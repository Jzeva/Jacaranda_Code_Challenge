# Jacaranda Finance Code Challenge

## Getting Started âœ¨ :sparkles:

### Code Challenge
Build a simple CLI script to retrieve and present the top 5 priced DeFi coins listed on the Binance exchange purely using web scraping and not an API integration. Produce a readme.md file with instructions on how to set up your environment and execute the CLI command to present the results.

If the CLI script were to be run today and given the following results seen on Binance's page https://www.binance.com/en-AU/markets/coinInfo-defi you program should output a response similar to:

```bash
-------------------
 TOP 5 DEFI PRICES
-------------------

1. YFI  - $13453.44
2. YFII - $ 1447.07

3. MKR  - $ 1105.44

4. BIFI - $  569.48

5. AUTO - $  417.48

-------------------
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm i
```
### Start the program

```bash
$ ./start.sh
```
